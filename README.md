# Discord RPC macOS Auto-Start

This script helps run Discord Rich Presence on macOS automatically.  
It sets permissions and configures auto-start with a single command.

## Quick Setup

1. **Install the Discord RPC extension in your browser:**  
   - [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/discord-rich-presence/agnaejlkbiiggajjmnpmeheigkflbnoo)  
   - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/discord-rich-presence/)

2. **Download the original Discord RPC files from the official release:**  
   - [GitHub Release 0.3.0](https://github.com/lolamtisch/Discord-RPC-Extension/releases/tag/0.3.0)  
   Extract the macOS zip - it contains:  
   - `server_macos_debug`
   - `start.sh` 

3. **Download `install.sh` from this fork** and place it in the **same folder** as the extracted files.

4. **Open Terminal in that folder** and run:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ```
   **Then**
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

That's it! The server will automatically run every time you log in.

## Verify

Check if the server is running:
```bash
ps aux | grep server_macos_debug
```

If you see a process for `server_macos_debug`, it's working.

## Logs

Output logs are saved in the same folder:
- `discord-rpc.log` - Standard output
- `discord-rpc-error.log` - Error messages
  
## Important: Discord App Setup
For the RPC to work, Discord must be running. To make Discord start automatically:

Open System Settings → General → Login Items & Extensions
Click the + button under "Open at Login"
Select Discord.app and add it

Now both Discord and the RPC server will start automatically.

## Uninstall

To remove the auto-start:
```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.discord.rpc.autorun.plist
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.discord.rpc.autorun.plist
```
